    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team)

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice()
    team2[3] = 'Sam'
    console.log(players, team2)

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const team4 = Array.from(players)

    const team5 = [...players]
    team5[3] = 'Zorro'
    console.log(players, team5)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:

    console.log(person, captain)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //const anotherPerson = {...person}

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
